### Shellcode Tester ###

-----

A shellcode testing utility that allows payloads to be disassembled in 32/64bit NASM syntax using [BeaEngine](http://www.beaengine.org/ "BeaEngine").

Tool also has the ability to run 32/64bit payloads against calc.exe for simulated testing. 

The application is targeted towards a 32bit build and allows shellcode to be tested against itself, but could easily be used for 64bit if modified.
